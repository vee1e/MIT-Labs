# Labs Repository

This repository contains lab work and resources for various semesters, organized by subject and experiment type. Below is an overview of the structure and contents.

## Semester 2
### Problem Solving Using Computers Lab
- **01 Simple C Programs**: Basic C programs and assignments (`.c` files)
- **02 Branching Control Structures**: C programs focusing on branching and control flow
- **03 While and Do-while loops**: Loop-based C programs
- **04 For loops**: C programs using for-loops
- **05 1D Arrays**: Programs involving one-dimensional arrays
- **06 2D Arrays**: Programs involving two-dimensional arrays
- **07 Strings**: String manipulation programs
- **08 Functions**: Programs demonstrating functions in C
- **09 Recursion, Structures and Pointers**: Advanced C programs on recursion, structures, and pointers
- **Endsem**: End semester exam programs and special problems

Each folder contains multiple `.c` files, including assignments (prefixed with `a`), and main exercises (numbered).

## Semester 4
### FPGA Based System Design Using Verilog Lab
- **Lab Manual.pdf**: Reference manual
- **Lab Work/**: Contains subfolders for each lab session (`lab_2` to `lab_7`), each with Verilog source (`.v`) and testbench (`_tb.v`) files for various digital design experiments
- **Mini Project/**: Project files, reports, images, and documentation (Verilog, Markdown, PDF, PNG, SVG, JPG)

### VLSI Design Lab
- **Lab Manual.pdf**: Reference manual
- **Lab Work/**: Contains subfolders for each lab session (`lab_1` to `lab_8`), each with Verilog source (`.v`), testbenches, and related files
- **Mini Project/**: Project documentation and reports (Markdown, PDF, ODT)
- **vlsi-notes.md**: Notes and references

## Semester 5
### Semiconductor Device and Process Simulation Lab
- **Manual/**: Contains experiment manuals in PDF format

## Notes
- Each lab folder is organized by experiment or topic.
- Source code is primarily in C (Semester 2) and Verilog (Semester 4).
- Project and report files are in Markdown, PDF, and image formats.
